# Event-HourlyCalendar
Simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

GIVEN THAT THIS IS IS AN ASSIGNMENT THAT ALREADY HAD A LOT OF STARTER CODE, THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TO ADD AND CHANGE TO THE CODE ITSELF AND I FINISHED IT WITH THE MOST SIMPLE AND STRAIGHT FORWARD METHOD OF CODE THAT I FOUND FROM COMPARING AND ASKING FOR ADVICE FROM ACADEMIC STAFF AND CLASSMATES CONSIDERING THE EXTREMELY LIMITED TIME ONE IS GIVEN TO DO PROJECTS AND HOMEWORKS ALONG WITH CLASS, FULL TIME JOB, BARELY ANY SLEEP AS WELL AS COMMUTE AND EATING. 


AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
